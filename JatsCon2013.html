                  <p id="d1e62">Tagging inconsistencies stretch across several aspects of the articles, ranging from
                     licensing to keywords to the media types of supplementary materials. While all of these
                     complicate large-scale reuse, the unclear licensing statements had the greatest impact,
                     requiring us to implement text mining-like algorithms in order to accurately determine
                     whether or not specific content was compatible with reuse on Wikimedia Commons.

               <p id="d1e73">The aim of this paper is to describe the problems that we came across when attempting to
                  reuse materials from the <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/" id="d1e75">PMC Open Access
                     Subset</a> in an automated fashion and at scale. Some of the issues are specific
                  to certain kinds of content, others are a barrier to reuse more generally. Some of them
                  are specific to individual articles, journals or publishers, while others apply more
                  widely.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e78">In discussing these issues, we take the perspective of a re-user of JATS-conveyed
                  content, conscious of the possibility that the perspectives of producers and curators of
                  this content and of maintainers of JATS standards may differ. We conclude with a series of
                  recommendations that would have facilitated the implementation of our reuse project and
                  that could serve as the basis for a discussion on how to facilitate reuse more
                  generally.

               <p id="d1e97">Currently, the OAMI harvests content from the PMC Open Access Subset. Since most articles
                  in the subset are actually not Open Access (in the sense of being free to reuse, revise,
                  remix and redistribute), the bot scans the XML sources of new articles and reads the
                  license information in order to determine those that are. It then checks whether these
                  have multimedia files in their supplementary materials. If so, they are downloaded,
                  converted and uploaded to Wikimedia Commons along with the available metadata. At the time
                  of writing, <a target="xrefwindow" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Uploaded_with_Open_Access_Media_Importer" id="d1e99">over 13,000 multimedia files</a> had been processed this way. Figure 1

                  "good" markup above, within the article XML available from the PMC OA subset,
                  licensing metadata is not expressed consistently across journals, and sometimes not even
                  across different articles of the same journal. &nbsp;Here, we list a few examples.

                  human-readable description adds the extra "NC" (non-commercial) restriction:

               <p id="d1e344">PMC recently implemented a search-by-license feature, described on their <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/" id="d1e346">Open
                     Access Subset</a> page. This feature allows users to query for articles matching
                  specific Creative Commons licenses, and can be combined with other search terms.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e349">Unfortunately, because of the tagging problems described above, the PMC indexer, in many
                  cases, cannot correctly determine the license of articles. Therefore, the search result
                  sets are much smaller than they otherwise would be.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e351">For example, in a sample of 100 articles that are in the OA subset, but that do not match
                  the "cc license" filter (<a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22open+access%22%5Bfilter%5D+NOT+%22cc+license%22%5Bfilter%5D" id="d1e353">PMC search</a>), it was found that 99 did, in fact, have CC licenses, but that
                  tagging problems prevented them from being correctly identified as such. At the time of
                  this writing, there were 663,843 articles in the OA subset, and 52% did not match the
                  "cc license" filter. If the sample described above is representative, then that
                  means about 340,000 eligible articles would not be discoverable through this search
                  feature.

               <p id="d1e359">In the OAMI, these problems necessitated the development of a fairly sophisticated
                  text-mining module that examined both the machine-readable URI in the &lt;license&gt;
                  element, as well as the human-readable expressions, so as to determine the publisher's
                  intent. Because of Wikimedia Commons' strict enforcement of proper licensing, it was
                  important that this module be conservative: &nbsp;false positives being much less acceptable
                  than false negatives.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e361">Development of a license-mining algorithm such as this is costly, and would tax the
                  resources of any project seeking to reuse PMC OA content. Even with this algorithm, the
                  inconsistency and number of errors that we found indicate that there are still a great
                  number of articles that could legitimately be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, but that are
                  not properly identified. This does a disservice to those who released their material with
                  reuse-friendly licenses, often in the hopes of having it be used as widely as
                  possible.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e363">The lack of ability to reliably determine licensing information on a per-article basis
                  contributes to other problems as well. One such problem is that publishers sometimes erect
                  paywalls around open access content, counter to the express wishes of the authors. One way
                  to explain this could be that the sites are not flexible enough to handle per-issue or
                  per-article license information. Perhaps, if the tagging of this information in JATS XML
                  documents were consistent and reliable, it would facilitate systems that were more
                  flexible, and able to serve open content directly, which still presenting a paywall for
                  closed content.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e365">As another example, the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) already allows one to
                  <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=byLicense" id="d1e367">list
                     journals by license</a>, and plans are afoot to expand this functionality to the
                  level of individual articles. Again, this could be facilitated by consistent and reliable
                  tagging of JATS XML articles.

               <p id="d1e381">Recently, some journals have begun to make data and supplementary materials available
                  under a license that differs from the main article's license. For example, F1000Research
                  is providing articles with text content that is available under CC-BY, but with
                  accompanying data available in the public domain (CC0). Here is an example of the tagging
                  of a recent article from their website:

&lt;/permissions&gt;</pre><p id="d1e385">The scope and the intent of each of the two &lt;license&gt; elements is clear to a human
                  reader, but, unfortunately, there is no way for an automated bot to be able to
                  unambiguously identify the two different scopes.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e387">If licensing information were available along with provenance on a per-file basis in a
                  machine-readable format, there would be potential for automated checks of licensing
                  information. Few scholars outside the field of copyright law are aware of all the
                  implications of publishing under certain licenses, which sometimes leads to content
                  available under a particular license being published (<a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.plosone.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=60001" id="d1e389">Example
                     1</a>) or re-published (<a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.plosbiology.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=53679" id="d1e392">Example
                     2</a>) in incompatibly licensed papers. In Example 1, the issue could be solved
                  by the copyright holder changing the licensing of the original file, whereas in Example 2,
                  a video displaying wrong license information was fixed and re-uploaded at the publisher's
                  site but <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485268/bin/pone.0046962.s003.mp4" id="d1e395">not at PMC</a>, despite the published correction.

               <p id="d1e398">There is no straightforward way to detect such cases algorithmically, and raising
                  awareness for these issues amongst authors, editors and reviewers can certainly not be
                  automated either.

                  the tags they define can be integrated with JATS. However, the simplest and most
                  fundamental way of robustly signaling a license will probably always be to unambiguously
                  link to a URI that's defined, controlled and perhaps versioned by an established
                  organization such as Creative Commons.

            <p id="d1e451">In addition to the problems with communicating the licensing terms, the media types of
               supplementary materials are frequently not indicated properly, which reduces discoverability
               and translates into extra efforts before any reuse becomes possible.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e453">Media types (originally called "MIME types") are two part identifiers that
               describe the format of a multimedia file. Familiar examples are "text/plain", and
               "application/xml". When serving these types of files, web servers provide the
               media type in the HTTP "Content-type" header. This allows the client to determine
               how the file should be processed. In the case of the OAMI, the processing is the conversion
               of the file format, since Wikimedia Commons only accepts audio or video files encoded in
               open formats.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e455">The JATS standard provides two attributes to allow for encoding the media types of files

               <p id="d1e687">Many of the problems described above were due to PMC's incorrectly adding @mimetype and
                  @mime-subtype attributes to XML that it received, based on the assumption that the media
                  file's extension accurately reflects its media type. When it was recognized that the
                  filename extension was not a reliable indicator of the media type, and that it's better to
                  have no declared media type than to have it wrong, PMC has stopped executing this
                  function.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e689">Also, in part because of the recognition that the values for @mimetype and @mime-subtype
                  being supplied by publishers was not reliable, PMC is in the process of changing the
                  Tagging Guidelines to make these attributes, when they appear on the &lt;media&gt;
                  element, optional.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e691">Also, in response to some of these problems, PMC has implemented a new feature in its
                  rendering software to ensure the accuracy of the "Content-type" header it
                  provides in response to HTTP requests for the media files. This makes use of the standard
                  Unix library <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?libmagic+3+NetBSD-current" id="d1e693">libmagic</a>, which is also used by the OAMI and determines a file's type based
                  on patterns of data within its content. In this way, PMC can be sure that it is delivering
                  accurate metadata in the HTTP response, based on the actual file at the time it is
                  served.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e696">There are no plans to retroactively fix the existing XML markup in the PMC database, or
                  to adjust the @mimetype or @mime-subtype attributes for any new articles received.

               <p id="d1e777">Because the values for keywords are unconstrained, and typically not members of a
                  controlled vocabulary, there is no way to validate them. This, of course, leads to
                  problems with typos, misspellings, differences in case, and so forth, that make them
                  difficult to process by machine.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e779">For example, we have noticed that in PLOS articles, a recurring typographical error is
                  encountered, in which a superfluous space is inserted into a keyword. When media files
                  from these articles are processed by the OAMI and uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, they are
                  thus assigned the Wikimedia Commons category "<a target="xrefwindow" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Biophysic_al_simulations" id="d1e781">Biophysic al simulations</a>". To work around this problem, we have
                  inserted a permanent redirect from that misspelled category to one with the proper
                  spelling. The presence of files in this redirected category then triggers another bot on
                  Wikimedia Commons to fix the categorization of affected files automatically.

               <p id="d1e792">Most of the time, the &lt;subj-group&gt; and &lt;subject&gt; elements are used to
                  specify, not keywords, but a subject heading that would appear in the Table of Contents
                  for a journal issue; and is often equivalent to the type of article, as
                  "Article", "Letter to Editor", "Meeting Notice", etc. When
                  used this way, the @subj-group-type attribute normally has the value
                  "heading".
               </p>
               <p id="d1e794">When using &lt;subj-group&gt; and &lt;subject&gt; elements to describe keywords, the JATS
                  specification suggests that the @subj-group-type attribute have a value of, for example,
                  "keywords". However, we found the use of this attribute to be very inconsistent.
                  Note in the "good" example above, that the value "Discipline-v2" is
                  used. In a sample of articles from the OA subset, often we saw no value at all given for
                  this attribute. Among those that did supply a value, we found the following:

               <p id="d1e884">We recommend that the PMC Tagging Guidelines and Style Checker be changed to require
                  that, if a license is defined by a URI (as are CC licenses), that the article
                  <i>must</i> put this URL into the @xlink:href on the &lt;license&gt; element.
                  This should be the sole place that a machine (or anyone) should need to look for the
                  license URI. (This is in contrast to the current guidelines, which state that it can be
                  tagged on an @xlink:href on either the &lt;license&gt; element, or on any &lt;ext-link&gt;
                  descendent of &lt;license&gt;.)
               </p>
               <p id="d1e889">If that were implemented, then it would no longer be necessary to do comparisons between
                  that URI and any other URI within the &lt;license-p&gt; elements, and this check should be
                  dropped. The rationale for this is that any content within the &lt;license-p&gt; elements
                  is intended for human, not machine, consumption, and might contain arbitrary hyperlinks,
                  which cannot be predicted, and should not be constrained.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e891">The PMC Style Checker could be enhanced to dynamically check the validity of any
                  creativecommons.org URIs that appear in that attribute. Creative Commons provides a web
                  service for this purpose (see, for example, <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://api.creativecommons.org/rest/dev/details?license-uri=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/" id="d1e893">this service call</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e896">Funders of scientific research that have open-access mandates might consider adding
                  the requirement that the licenses be tagged according to the best practices
                  described here.  That would facilitate automated tools that could verify that the
                  work does, indeed, conform to their OA requirements.

               <p id="d1e901">The license metadata for articles in the PMC archive, because it is based on the markup
                  of the source XML, is not reliable. One effect of this, as discussed above, is that it
                  detracts from the usefulness of the search-by-license feature.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e903">PMC could improve the way this license data is derived, re-using some of the business
                  rules by which it determines which articles become part of the OA subset.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e905">Also, as part of this project, we curated the license data for thousands of articles in
                  the PMC OA subset. It would be nice if PMC would incorporate that data back into their
                  system, so that future users would not have to duplicate our effort.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e907">The license data that does reside in the PMC system should be better exposed. For
                  example, we recommend that it be added to the E-utilities esummary output for articles,
                  for both PubMed and PMC.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e909">For articles that have multiple licenses, which either change over time, or apply to
                  different parts (for example, one license for the article proper, and another for data),
                  we suggest that there be one &lt;license&gt; element for each, and that the @specific-use
                  attribute be used to define the scope. The default scope would be "article", but
                  if, for example, there were a different license for the data, then that would be marked up
                  as follows.

               <p id="d1e920">The PMC Tagging Guidelines should be changed to require the media types to be in the
                  @mimetype attribute only, and deprecate @mime-subtype. The Style Checker should verify
                  that the @mimetype attribute is present, that it has a valid form, and that @mime-subtype
                  is not given.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e922">PMC could develop a media type checking utility, using the same libmagic Unix library and
                  data files, to be applied to data and media files that accompany articles for ingest. The
                  system could fix the @mimetype attributes in the source XML to reflect the actual media
                  types as determined by this library. As mentioned above, PMC has fixed the HTTP
                  "content-type" headers, but if someone were to download the article and
                  accompanying media files, and share them outside of the PMC system, the mismatch in the
                  source XML could still be a problem.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e924">Perhaps this utility could also function to validate the multimedia and other data files
                  that are received. Since these files form an integral part of the scientific record, just
                  as with the source XML, the validity of these files is important. Since the operation of
                  the OAMI began, we have found on the order of 100 video files which could not be
                  processed, because some essential information (for example, the frame rate, or
                  intermediate I-frames) is not given, or not in a proper way (<a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.plosone.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=65463" id="d1e926">example</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e929">Such a data validation system could start with a small set of file types, for which
                  consistency checks could be set up. The consistency checker could be made available as a
                  web service, and the Tagging Guidelines could recommend (but not require) that files be
                  provided in those formats, and link to the web service.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e931">As mentioned above, <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/10055/RP-15-2013_Supplemental_Materials.pdf" id="d1e933">NISO RP-15-2013</a> has recently been published, and we encourage publishers to
                  adopt these recommendations. We note that there is another paper within these conference
                  proceedings, "<a target="xrefwindow" href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/2013/schedule2013a.html#2-900" id="d1e936">Extending
                     JATS to include the NISO/NFAIS Recommended Practices for Online Supplemental Journal

               </p>
               <p id="d1e939">However, we would also like to note that we have concerns about these recommendations,
                  that mirror some of the concerns that we have expressed about JATS in general.
                  Specifically, we feel that the recommendations are, in many cases, not conducive to
                  producing consistent, robust, and machine readable metadata.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e941">For example, in the description of the <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://supplemental.niso.org/tag-library/index.html?elem=license" id="d1e943">&lt;license&gt;</a> element, they say, "The &lt;ext-link&gt; can be used to
                  link to licenses that are already defined, such as a Creative Commons license." This
                  should not be discretionary. The specification should be explicit that when a URI exists
                  that identifies a license, that it must be included, and in a well-defined place. Note
                  that this schema allows multiple &lt;ext-link&gt; elements under &lt;license&gt;, so the
                  ambiguities that exist in JATS, that have led to such wide variation in tagging of this
                  metadata, are continued in this new recommendation.

               <p id="d1e957">Many of the issues discussed here could in principle be fixed by running some dedicated
                  scripts over the affected XML files. However, even if such scripts were functional and
                  readily available, there is currently no mechanism that would allow such fixes to be fed
                  back systematically and automatically to the respective sources of these XML files, or to
                  third-party copies thereof. One step in this direction would be to make the XML files
                  available in an updatable environment with public versioning. This would be possible for
                  articles in the Open Access Subset. Indeed, <a target="xrefwindow" href="https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xml" id="d1e959">eLife</a> and <a target="xrefwindow" href="https://github.com/pensoft" id="d1e962">Pensoft</a> have
                  demoed this on GitHub, and a tool for <a target="xrefwindow" href="https://github.com/konrad/JATS-to-Mediawiki" id="d1e965">porting JATS XML to MediaWiki
                     environments</a> exists as well.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e968">Various kinds of modifications to existing XML are theoretically plausible that would
                  merit adoption of such a system. These include – but are not limited to – typos,
                  corrigenda and retractions, but also license changes (e.g. when copyright owner changes
                  licensing backwards, or when copyright expires), media type mismatches, missing or mixed
                  up files, captions or unique identifiers, or "in press" references.

               <p id="d1e973">So far, JATS has mainly been used to exchange information between publishers and
                  archives. Under traditional notions of copyright, large-scale reuse of such information by
                  third parties is very limited but PMC's Open Access Subset – particularly the
                  Wikimedia-compatibly licensed portions thereof – opens the door for experimentation on
                  this front. We see value here in introducing the concept of use cases and collaborating
                  with suitable use case partners in further developing JATS as well as the corresponding
                  guidelines and style checkers. The OAMI bot could serve as one such use case. <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-85" id="d1e975">Species
